This project involved performing clustering analysis on datasets using various clustering techniques such as KMeans, GMM, and Hierarchical Clustering. Additionally, data preprocessing was done on the datasets using regression models like RandomForestRegressor, KNN imputer, and Linear Regressor to impute the missing values. The optimal number of clusters was found using different techniques, and the clusters were visualized using scatter plots and heatmaps. This project shows that clustering analysis can be effectively performed on datasets using different techniques, and data preprocessing can be used to prepare the data for clustering analysis.
